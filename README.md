# 08_Homework_Team_Profile_Generator

## Description

The motivation for this project was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person, with the addition of tests to ensure code is maintainable.

I learnt about using node js, Inquirer, file system, command line, markdowns and much more.
